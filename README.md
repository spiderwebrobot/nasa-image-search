# React + TypeScript + Vite + TanStack Query + Material UI

## TODO

- Setup and installation instructions
- A brief description of your approach and design decisions
- An overview of which technologies used were previously familiar to you, vs which were new
- Any assumptions youâ€™ve made
- What you would add/remove/change with more time

## Technologies

I was familiar with React, TypeScript, and Vite before this project, and had no experience with TanStack Query and Material UI.

## Given more time

I would...

- Figure out how to NOT fetch data on initial page load
- Find an elegant solution for loading the overlay-images
- Explore the [View Transition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API)
